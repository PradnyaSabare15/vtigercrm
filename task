<p>My Location is Pune</p>
<p>Pune exemplifies an indigenous Marathi culture and ethos, in which education, arts and crafts, and theatres are given due prominence. It is the birthplace of the poet-saint Tukaram (in Dehu) and Jnaneshvara (in Alandi), the author of the well-known commentary 'Jnaneshwari',on the “Bhagavad Gita”.</p>
